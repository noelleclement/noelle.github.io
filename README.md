Look at me finally coding my own website wow. To be clear: with 'from scratch' I mean I'm not using any Wordpress templates or the like. Of course I'm using frameworks and getting code from tutorials (or parts of other websites, when I'm being creative).

So this has definitely been a long time coming, since coding a very basic HTML/CSS website was part of the CS curriculum at my high school. 
As I'm not necessarily interested in webapplications this wasn't the most obvious project for me, but I found it a good challenge for trying something different. Also the idea of having a portfolio website spoke to me, so thus the idea was born!

So far the website thought me the concepts of: (not all may (still) be featured on the website)
- HTML5
- CSS3, including making a website responsive
- Bootstrap
- Very basic Javascript
- Very basic PHP
- Using Formspree instead of having an attempt at PHP and mailservers (as one of my teachers says: being lazy can actually get you better results)
- Actually using the extra's Sublime Text has to offer (packages, prettifying code)
- Adding usage of .hcaccess so .html is erased from URL's and my website looks a bit more professional
- Finding out that even widely used frameworks like Bootstrap have quite some bugs in them that makes it very easy for you to spent hours on an issue that isn't really solvable (other than spending more hours on getting around it). Sometimes the best solution is the easiest one, people.
